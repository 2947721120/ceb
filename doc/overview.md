<code>&lt;ceb/&gt;</code> is a library helping to develop [Custom Elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/).

It's core is a builder which execute others builders.
By this way, <code>&lt;ceb/&gt;</code> is natively open to extensions and builders easily sharable. 

Obviously, <code>&lt;ceb/&gt;</code> exposes builders to handle the common needs:

- property
- attribute
- events
- delegation (attribute, property and method)
- templating

<br/>
The example folder exposes builders based on external libraries like baconjs, redux, handlerbars and others. 

Some helpers (event dispatching, type checking, ...) are also exposed.
