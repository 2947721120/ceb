# Usage

The entry point is the [element()](element.md) builder.

Then, the following builders can be used according the use cases of the future custom element:

* [property()](property.md)
* [attribute()](attribute.md)
* [method()](method.md)
* [delegate()](delegate.md)
* [on()](on.md)
* [template()](template.md)

Finally, the implementation of builders is covered by the page [Internal stuff](internal-stuff.md).
